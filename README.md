# üõçÔ∏è Vue.js E-Commerce Website

This is a simple e-commerce website built with **Vue.js** using the [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com). The app demonstrates core e-commerce functionalities like category-based browsing, product search, favoriting items, tracking last visited products, pagination, and more.
